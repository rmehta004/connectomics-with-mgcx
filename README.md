# Funtional Connectomics with Cross Multiscale Graph Correlation
Scripts and data for applying Cross Multiscale Graph Correlation ([`mgcx`](https://github.com/neurodata/mgcpy)) to functional connectomic data, uncovering temporal relationships in the brain.

This include Python examples for running `mgcx`, SLURM scripts for running compute jobs on the Maryland Advance Research Computing Center (MARCC), and data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Midnight Scan Club (MSC).
